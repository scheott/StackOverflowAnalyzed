# Analyzation of StackOverflow Data
## Introduction
This project I aimed to dive deep into the data from Stack Overflow using the power of SQL for data extraction and transformation. I wanted to also get experience with creating a realtional database and show my PowerBI skills obtained from internship experience.

## Database Creation and Data Cleaning
Using SQLite, I created  adatabse for Question, Answer, and Tags data. This data was obtianed from the stack overflow data dump, so there was a lot of work to do with cleaning. Using some SQL Queries and python code the data was very usable.

## Data Visualizations
Using PowerBI, I created a few tabs of vizualizations that show interesting insight, I also created some drill throughs so you can look through indivdual Questions and answers

## Conclusion
In conlcusion, I gained a lot of knowledge about Databases and gained confidence in SQL, there were a lot of interesting insights gathered from questions and answers in StackOverflow.
