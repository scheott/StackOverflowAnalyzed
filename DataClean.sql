-- 1. Remove Rows with Missing Values
-- Delete rows where title is NULL
DELETE FROM CombinedData WHERE Title IS NULL;

-- Delete rows where the answer is NULL

-- 2. Remove Duplicate Rows
-- Assuming that a combination of QuestionId, AnswerId, and Tag defines a unique row
DELETE FROM CombinedData
WHERE rowid NOT IN (

-- Remove leading and trailing whitespaces from text columns
UPDATE CombinedData

-- 4. Normalize Text Data
-- Convert text fields to lowercase for consistency
UPDATE CombinedData

-- 5. Filter Out Irrelevant Data
-- Delete rows where the question score is less than 0

-- 6. Check for Date Inconsistencies and Rectify Them
-- Ensure closed dates are after creation dates
UPDATE CombinedData

-- 7. Handle Duplicate Tags (assuming a question can have multiple tags)
-- This will create a comma-separated list of tags for each question
-- This assumes that there's no question with multiple identical tags.
-- If not, a more complex deduplication should be used.
